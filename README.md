# Simple Math Interpreter

![](https://github.com/CoolDeveloper101/simple-math-interpreter/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

This is the new version of the math interpreter since it got extremely hard to update and add new tests to it. So this is the same interpreter with a better structure so it is easier to maintain.

He created the original interpreter in python and I basically converted to a c# project.
